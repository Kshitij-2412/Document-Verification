# Document Verification and OCR System

## Overview
This project is a robust Machine Learning application designed to automate the verification of various documents, including Aadhar Card, PAN Card, and Cheque Leaf. Leveraging state-of-the-art Deep Learning techniques, the system ensures accurate document verification. Additionally, it provides an API for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract textual information from these documents.

## Features
- **Document Verification**: Accurately verifies Aadhar Cards, PAN Cards, and Cheque Leaves.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Extracts and reads text from documents using EasyOCR.
- **Pre-trained Model Integration**: Utilizes the VGG16 model from TensorFlow as a feature extractor.
- **API Accessibility**: Provides a user-friendly API built with Flask for seamless integration.

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for training on image datasets.
- **Pre-trained Models**: VGG16 from TensorFlow for feature extraction.
- **OCR**: EasyOCR for reading text from images.
- **API**: Flask for building the API endpoints.
- **Dataset**: Sourced from Kaggle for training and validation.
